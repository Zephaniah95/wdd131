        <h3>Faith and Compassion</h3>
         <p>
      Faith and compassion go hand in hand — one strengthens our trust in God, while the other moves us to act with love toward others. 
      Faith is not simply believing that God exists; it is living with confidence in His promises and trusting in His timing. 
      Compassion then becomes the expression of that faith — a living testimony of God's love in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jesus saw the multitude hungry, sick, and tired, His heart was “moved with compassion toward them” (<strong>Mark 6:34</strong>). 
      Through faith, we learn to see others as God sees them — with patience, mercy, and understanding. Compassion helps us reach out to the poor, 
      the lonely, and those who have lost hope. Faith gives us strength to continue even when life feels uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scripture Thought:</strong> “And now as I said concerning faith — faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; 
      therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.” (<strong>Alma 32:21</strong>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lesson:</strong> True faith makes us instruments in God’s hands. It softens our hearts, awakens compassion, 
      and turns our belief into meaningful action that blesses others.

        <h3>Service to Humanity</h3>
         <p>
      Service is one of the greatest ways to show our love for God and our neighbors. It is more than doing good deeds — 
      it is a way of life that reflects the Savior’s example. When we serve, we forget ourselves and discover joy in lifting others. 
      The gospel of Jesus Christ calls us to strengthen the weak, comfort the weary, and bring light to those who dwell in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Savior Himself taught, “Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister” (<strong>Matthew 20:26</strong>). 
      In every act of kindness — whether visiting the sick, teaching a child, or giving time to a neighbor — we become co-workers with Christ in His divine mission. 
      Service builds unity and helps us grow in humility and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scripture Thought:</strong> “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.” 
      (<strong>Mosiah 2:17</strong>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lesson:</strong> Every small act of service counts in heaven’s eyes. As we serve others, we find purpose, peace, and a deeper connection with the Savior.

        <img src="images/teaching3.jpeg" alt="Hope and Forgiveness">
        <h3>Hope and Forgiveness</h3>
        <p>
      Hope is the anchor of the soul — it keeps us steady when life’s storms rise. Forgiveness, meanwhile, frees our hearts from the weight of anger and pain. 
      Together, they renew our spirit and help us see life with divine perspective. Hope teaches us to trust in God’s mercy; forgiveness helps us to live it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Savior taught us to forgive “seventy times seven” (<strong>Matthew 18:22</strong>), showing that forgiveness should be endless and sincere. 
      Through repentance and faith, we find hope in Christ’s infinite Atonement. No matter how far we’ve strayed, His grace invites us to return, 
      begin again, and feel peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scripture Thought:</strong> “Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, 
      and a love of God and of all men.” (<strong>2 Nephi 31:20</strong>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lesson:</strong> Hope reminds us that God’s promises are sure; forgiveness reminds us that love conquers all. 
      Together they heal, uplift, and lead us closer to eternal joy in Christ.
