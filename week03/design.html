                <p>üíØ Good design is more than decoration; it is problem-solving. The principles of design‚Äîbalance, contrast, alignment, repetition, proximity, and hierarchy‚Äîguide us in creating work that communicates clearly and feels effortless to the user. Balance gives stability, contrast draws attention, alignment creates order, repetition builds consistency, proximity shows relationships, and hierarchy directs the eye to what matters most. When these principles come together, design stops being just what we see, and becomes what we experience. As designers, our task is not only to make things look beautiful, but to make them meaningful, functional, and timeless.</p>

            <h3>Color Contrast</h3>
            <p>This color contrast violates accessiblity rules. Color is more than decoration‚Äîit is communication. Contrast in color helps us guide the eye, create emphasis, and ensure accessibility. A strong contrast between text and background makes content readable, while subtle contrasts add depth and hierarchy. Too little contrast leaves designs flat and confusing; too much can feel harsh. The key is balance‚Äîusing contrast to highlight what matters most, while maintaining harmony. When applied with care, color contrast doesn‚Äôt just make a design beautiful, it makes it usable, inclusive, and unforgettable.</p>
